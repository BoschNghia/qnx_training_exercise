    * Heap & dynamic memory allocation
    * Stack (each thread has a separated stack)
    * Shared objects
    * Shared libraries

  * Cross processes memory access?
    ```
    $ cd samples
    $ make clean
    $ make memory
    $ setarch $(uname -m) -R ./memory
    ```

  * Virtual memory

* Process
  * [Definitions](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.prog/topic/overview_Definitions.html)
    > A thread is a single flow of execution or control.

    > A process is a collection of resources shared by one or more threads

    > Each process lives in its own protected memory space. (QNX/An application as a set of processes)

  * Creation
    ```
    #include <stdlib.h>
    int system( const char *command );
    ```

  * Termination
    ```
    #include <stdlib.h>
    void exit( int status );
    ```

    * API
    * Resource cleanup
    * Exit Code
      * Why do we care? [Safety] Fault detection & reaction
      * In simple cases, Shellscript could be used to handle the termination of a process
        ```
        <execute a command>

        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Error: The command failed."
        else
          echo "Success: The command ran successfully."
        fi
        ```

      * C Progams
        * Status macros
          * `WIFEXITED(stat_val)`
          * `WEXITSTATUS(stat_val)`

        * Child processes created via `system()`
        * Child processes created via `exec()`
          ```
          #include <sys/types.h>
          #include <sys/wait.h>

          // Suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.
          pid_t wait(int * stat_loc); // Any child process
          pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int * stat_loc, int options);  // Note: Group ID!
          ```

* Signals (TODO)

* IPC (in-progress)
  * Message passing (introduction only)
  * Shared memory
    * Flows
      * Owner setup shared memory area: size & characteristics (access permissions)
      * Peers map the shared memory area to their vm space

* [Time](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.prog/topic/timing_Time_functions.html)
  * `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`: a monotonic count of time since the kernel was initialized
  * `CLOCK_REALTIME`: the current calendar time/wall-clock (seconds since the Unix Epoch, 00:00:00 January 1, 1970)
  * `Local time = CLOCK_REALTIME + Offset (depends on time zone & dst)`
  * [Execution times for processes and threads](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.prog/topic/timing_execution_times.html)
  * Notes
    * `CLOCK_REALTIME` could be adjusted at runtime! => should not be used for profiling purposes!
    * "The OS actually just counts time since booting" => `Wall-clock time = Monotonic time + Offset`
    * [Network Time Protocol](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.utilities/topic/n/ntpd.html)
    * Timestamps & Security: preventing Replay Attacks, ensuring Data Integrity, ...

  * Microkernel (`procnto` system process)
    * Process, Thread & Signals management
    * Scheduling & Synchronization services
    * Memory management
    * Message-passing services
    * Timer services

  * All OS services, except those provided by the mandatory microkernel/process manager module (procnto), are handled via standard processes
    * Filesystem managers
    * Character device managers
    * Native network manager
    * TCP/IP

    > System processes are essentially indistinguishable from any user-written programâ€”they use the same public API and kernel services available to any (suitably privileged) user process.

  * Kernel calls (TODO)

* Practice #2: IPC with Shared Memory
